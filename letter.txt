Hi, IT-Academy!
One year ago I decided to change my proffesional path on 180 degrees.
I want to change "stable") profession of a system administrator in the civil service to interesting, creative, developing with a lot of different technologies profession of a devops-engineer.
After successful finishing of devops-course in IT-Academy I've finished English course.
At the moment I continue to work as a system administrator using the acquired skills and looking for an internship or a position of a junior devops-engineer.
I really want to get into BootCamp for getting real experience working on a project in a team.
I'm ready to spend all my time applying my skills and knowledge and acquiring new ones participating in the seminar.
After the practice I'm sure that I'll find a job quickly, because all failures were due to lack of practical experience.
I'd be happy to be part of the team!!!
